title: human.intheloop
desc: How can human and AI work together in the future?
caption: Nabi AI Open Lab
brief: New media art and research project regarding how AI will change the way people work and the pyramid of society.
context: A new workforce performing human intelligence tasks, such as data labeling and annotation, has emerged in the fourth industrial revolution. Their efforts contribute to further refining artificial intelligence models designed to replace human labor.
solution: Our work intends to provide an interactive and gamified experience for the audience to perform such labor firsthand and visualize the compensations in return.
