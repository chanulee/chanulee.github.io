title: NFT Image Copyright Protection System using Image Layer based Creator Authentication
desc: How might we protect creators copyright using non-fungible token? 
caption: Korea Computer Congress 2022
brief: Proposing a mechanism to identify and verify the real creator of an artwork by checking the layers of the project file.
context: It is not known whether the current NFT transaction can be judged as a valid copyright transaction or whether the published NFT is a stolen work, and there is no institutional protection against copyright-related disputes. 
solution: This paper certifies that the creator is the creator of issuing NFT based on the layer generated in the process of working on digital creations, and suggests a mechanism to protect the copyright of the image NFT by encoding it on the blockchain.
