brief: 'Dept. of Web & Land Property (DWLP)' deals with the relationship between the web and our lives, government and data, imagining fictional ministry that governs web resources, which is limited.
context: ‘DWLP’ is set in the near future when the depletion of web resources is beginning to be recognized by the public and managed by the Department that seeks market stability and balanced development between land, the physical home of citizens, and the web, the practical home of citizens.
