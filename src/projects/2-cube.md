title: "CUBE: Multi-modal Personal Controller for Future Mobility"
desc: What kind of interface and interaction is needed in the future of mobility technology?
caption: ETRI
brief: CUBE is an interface and interaction design project that researched what kind of interaction people can do in the moving medium - mobility(cars) - when the fourth stage of autonomous driving is commercialized in the future.
context: With Auto driving 4.0, People will have more spare time in vehicles in the future. To imagine various scenarios and design an interface for them is needed.
solution: Came up with Multi-modal, Surface shifting Interface and Seat
