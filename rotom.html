			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
			Project Rotom is a creative practice and research aimed at creating a more personal, fluid, and context-aware computer. Imagine your computer as a ChatGPT (or a clever and friendly Rotom) that assists you with files, schedules, and emails, and even automates some tedious tasks.<br  /> </p>
			<h3>Vision</h3>
			<p>
			To build a computer interface and system that is built ground up from the AI. 
			</p>
			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>
			It's essential to experiment with various approaches, one at a time. Goal for 2025 is to build a novel design and engineering solution, based on diverse experiments in software design, physical form factors, system architecture, and AI.
			<br  />
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>
			The computer's role has always been like a bicycle for the mind, augmenting human ability to be creative or complete tasks more quickly, thus freeing time and effort for more valuable pursuits. Especially in our world, which is more complex than ever in terms of information, artificial intelligence can help us manage this complexity. Computers have become multifaceted – they are workstations, family photo albums, gaming machines, windows for socializing, and more. They contain an overwhelming amount of information – documents, websites, emails, schedules, messages, music, photos, locations, etc. These elements are interconnected and related. However, the computers we use are not designed to connect these dots. Originally, computers were simple, linear machines, meant to perform tasks separately and sequentially. But we now understand that information is not linear, as demonstrated by the web and hypertext. So, how can we redesign the computer to collect, connect, and present all this complex information in a simple, linear manner?
